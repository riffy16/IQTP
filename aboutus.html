        <h2>The N.E.R.D.</h2>
        <p>IQTalent Partners has also built a world class sourcing team based in Nashville, TN.  We call this team the Nashville Executive Research Division (NERD).  NERDs undergo a rigorous interview and training process  to ensure a strong team that benefits from the diverse backgrounds and experiences. NERDs benefit from a culture that encourages collaboration and cooperation in order to best utilize the array of skills NERDs bring to the table.</p>

        <h3>"The definition of a NERD will never be static… [it] means never being satisfied with the status quo and always finding ways to improve… it’s why our clients come back to us and refer us to other clients. Quality is not what defines a NERD, it’s synonymous with being a NERD."</h3>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p><strong>We strive to offer a better way for organizations and candidates to find a match.</strong>  We find the right talent for our clients, and we present good career opportunities to our candidates. We are not focused on completing a transaction.  We are focused on making our clients and candidates successful.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="jumbotron">
          <h2>Our Culture</h2>
          <p><strong>We focus on other’s success.</strong> We believe that if we create success for our clients, candidates, and teammates our success will follow.</p>
          <p><strong>We are authentic and real.</strong> We talk straight.  We are not slick sales people.</p>
          <p><strong>We are effective.</strong> We have a performance culture that emphasizes responsibility and accountability.</p>
          <p><strong>We are good teammates</strong> We strive to be an extension of our client’s teams, and within IQTalent, we work together as a team.</p>
          <p><strong>We are confident, but always striving to improve.</strong> We are confident that we can deliver for our clients, but we are always seeking feedback from our clients so that we can improve.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="jumbotron">
        <h2>Work Environment</h2>
        <h4>Fun</h4>
        <p>We specifically allocate funds that encourage NERDs to gather outside of work, whether it be happy hours, company kickball and dodgeball, or The Escape Game.</p>
        <h4>Flexibility</h4>
        <p>Although IQTalent Partners maintain a comfortable office, we understand that individuals have unique work styles, which can sometime benefit from the solitude and comfort of a day at home. There are benefits to gain from short breaks, a change in scenery or working at unconventional hours. With the same technology we use to ensure that we can work with clients all over the globe, we foster work life integration by ensuring that everyone can work remotely when it’s beneficial to them. </p>
        <h4>Community Engagement</h4>
        <p>When it comes down to it, our business is about facilitating multidimensional relationships that benefits everyone involved. Although our clients and partners are scattered across the globe, the NERD strives to engage and serve locally by planning monthly optional volunteer events that takes our team out of the office and into the community. The “NERDnitiative,” as we call it, has weeded community gardens, cooked for a local nonprofit that provides meals, and hosted career service workshops for refugees.</p>
